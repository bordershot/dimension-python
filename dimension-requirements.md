Python Basics:
Understand python basics
-Understand ‘if, else if, else’ statements
-Understand ‘while’ and ‘for’ loops.
-LISTS – be able to create, modify, and retrieve a specific item in that LIST
-DICTIONARIES – be able to create, traverse, and retrieve a certain value from that key
-FUNCTIONS – Write a simple python module that returns something, or can be just a simple print statement, and write a separate main script that imports that module and does something with it.
  -This will help John get familiar with functions
  -This will help john understand what ‘import’ really does (difference between ‘from XX import XX, import XX, import *’)

Python Environment:
Packages
-How to install/remove packages with ‘pip’
-Understand the usage of ‘requirements.txt’
-List installed modules in that particular python environment
-Familiarize yourself with virtualenv and the benefits of it

Useful Modules:
-Get familiar with module ‘argparse’
  -One of the arguments should be mandatory while another one is optional
  -If the number of arguments is incorrect, properly display the ‘help’ menu
-Get familiar with the ‘requests’ module. Write a script that performs http GET/POST requests.
-Load JSON module and play around with how to parse JSON objects

Projects:
-Write something in python that can ssh to a remote system, get data back (e.g. ls), and checks if something exists/matches
  -In addition, write code that will catch an exception (e.g. if you can’t ssh into that box, inform the user with a simple ERROR message.

Extra Credit:
-Read over PEP8 and just familiarize yourself with a little of it.
  -Run ‘pyflakes’ or ‘flake8’ against your code to see what it does and understand why it’s giving you errors
-Write unit tests for your scripts
-I know John runs some trending graphs at home. Write python script(s) that will retrieve the metrics from his home devices and POST it to his trending backend.
